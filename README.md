Hi, I’m Thomas and welcome to my Github. I’m interested in software development and/or data analytics.
I’m currently learning python and using the #100DaysofCode challenge through Udemy to do so. You can check my Twitter for daily updates on how this is going, and what I've created each day.
You can reach me via email at hudsonthomas55@gmail.com or at my Twitter link below.
